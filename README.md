#### vimrc for python 



- delete your vim config file completely 

- install the required dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install curl vim exuberant-ctags git ack-grep
sudo pip install pep8 flake8 pyflakes isort yapf
```
- download the .vimrc file and place it in your linux home folder

- run vim and wait..




- `<F5>` run in command line
- `<F6>` is equal to `python manage.py runserver`
- `<c-j>` quickrun in vim bottom 
- `<c-d>` Go to definition
- `<c-d>` Go to definition in new tab
and more, enjoy
